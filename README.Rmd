[Pre-commit hooks](https://pre-commit.com) are tests that run each time you
attempt to commit. If the tests pass, the commit will be made, otherwise not. A
very basic test is to check if the code is parsable, making sure you have not
forgotten a comma, brace or quote.

The goal of this package is to twofold:

- Provide a set of hooks that are useful when your git repo contains R code. You
  can find them under `vignette("available-hooks")`.

- Provide [usethis](https://github.com/r-lib/usethis)-like functionality for
  common tasks such as installation and set-up and config file modification.

## Installation

You can install the package from CRAN:

```{r}
install.packages("precommit")
```

To access pre-commit functionality from R, you also need to install the
[pre-commit framework](https://pre-commit.com). The following command line methods are tested to work with 
this R package:

- `$ pip3 install pre-commit --user` (macOS, Linux and Windows) **outside** a 
  conda or virtual environment.

- `$ brew install pre-commit` (macOS).

Alternatively, you can handle the installation from R using 
[miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html):

- install miniconda if you don't have it already: `reticulate::install_miniconda()`.
  This needs reticulate >= 1.14.

- install the pre-commit framework with `precommit::install_precommit()` into 
  the conda environment `r-precommit`. Do not install other packages into this
  environment.

Then, in a fresh R session:

```{r}
# once in every git repo either
# * after cloning a repo that already uses pre-commit or
# * if you want introduce pre-commit to this repo
precommit::use_precommit()
```

The last command initializes pre-commit in your repo and performs some set-up
tasks like creating the config file `.pre-commit-config.yaml`, where the hooks
that will be run on `git commit` are specified. See
`?precommit::use_precommit()` to see how you can use a custom
`.pre-commit-config.yaml` instead of the default at initialization. You can
(obviously) change edit the file manually at any time.

## Usage 

The next time you run `git commit`, the hooks listed in your
`.pre-commit-config.yaml` will get executed before the commit. The helper
function `precommit::open_config()` let's you open and edit the
`.pre-commit-config.yaml` conveniently from the RStudio console. When any file
is changed due to running a hook or the hook script errors, the commit will
fail. You can inspect the changes introduced by the hook and if satisfied, you
can add the changes made by the hook to the index with `git add path/to/file` 
and attempt to commit again. Some hooks change files, like the styler hook, so 
all you need to do to make the hook pass is `git add` the changes
introduced by the hook. Other hooks, like the parsable-R hook, will need 
your action, e.g. add a missing closing brace to a call like `library(styler`,
before they pass at the next attempt. If all hooks pass, the commit is made. You
can also [temporarily disable hooks](https://pre-commit.com/#temporarily-disabling-hooks). 
If you succeed, it should look like this:

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("man/figures/screenshot.png")
```

See the hooks provided by this repo under `vignette("available-hooks")`. You can
also add other hooks from other repos, by extending the
`.pre-commit-config.yaml` file, e.g. like this:

```yaml
-   repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/precommit
    rev: v1.2.3
    hooks: 
    -   id: check-added-large-files
```

To update the hook revisions, run `precommit::autoupdate()`.

## Caution 

- **Do not abort while hooks are running in RStudio git tab.** Non-staged
  changes are stashed to a temp directory and when you abort in RStudio, these
  changes are not brought back to you repo. Upvote [this
  issue](https://github.com/rstudio/rstudio/issues/6471) to change this. We hope
  that in the future, the changes will be recovered in RStudio too. Note that
  this is only an issue with RStudio. Stashes are restored when you abort a `git
  commit` with `INT` (e.g. Ctrl+C) on the command line. To restore stashes,
  manually after hitting *abort* in the RStudio git tab, you can `git
  apply /path/to/patch_with_id` whereas you find the patch under your pre-commit
  cache, which is usually under `$HOME/.cache/pre-commit/`.

- Because R is not officially supported as a language in the pre-commit
  framework (yet), there is no R package dependency management for the R hooks
  provided in this repo. If an R package that is needed by a hook is not yet
  installed, you might get this error:

```{r}
# > Error in loadNamespace(name) : there is no package called ‘__name_of_package__’
```
  In that case, just install the package with `install.packages()` once and 
  try to commit again.
  All R dependencies of the pre-commit hooks provided in this repo are suggested
  dependencies of this R package, so if you want to install them all, just 
  `install.packages("precommit", dependencies = c("Imports", "Suggests"))`.
  
## Documentation

The [online
documentation](https://lorenzwalthert.github.io/precommit/index.html) of this
package only covers the functionality added on top of pre-commit by this
package. Everything else is covered in the extensive [online
documentation](https://pre-commit.com) of the pre-commit framework itself,
including how to:

- create pre-push hooks

- create local hooks

- and more

## Update

To update the pre-commit executable, use the update utilities provided by 
your installation method. If you chose conda, you can use 
`precommit::update_precommit()`.

You can check the version of you executable with `precommit::version_precommit()`.

## Uninstallation

```{r}
uninstall_precommit("repo") # just for the repo you are in.
uninstall_precommit("user") # remove the pre-commit conda executable.
```
